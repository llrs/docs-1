## Avoid name collisions

While it is technically possible to host a fork or completely different package with the same name in a universe,
we strongly recommend your **not** doing it.

- An user might mistakenly install the `example` package from CRAN rather than the version from an universe.
R will automatically overwrite one package with the other when running `install.packages()` or `update.packages()`.
- It becomes even trickier when other packages import the package.

Therefore, when two packages have the same name, and one of them is on CRAN, R-universe: 
- treats the one that is on CRAN as the official version. 
- warns users against the duplication on the page of the other package. 

## Reserved names

The following names should be avoided as package name because `https://username.r-universe.dev/{pkg}/` has special meaning:

-  api 
-  apis 
-  articles 
-  badges 
-  bin 
-  builds 
-  citation 
-  contributors 
-  datasets 
-  docs 
-  favicon.ico 
-  feed.xml 
-  index.xml 
-  manual 
-  packages 
-  readme 
-  robots.txt 
-  sitemap_index.xml 
-  sitemap.xml 
-  src 
-  stats

## Code of Conduct

Maintainers of universes are solely responsible for their projects.

The R-universe project itself is governed by the [rOpenSci code of conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/).
