title: "Browsing work from a maintainer or organization"
---

Each user and organization in R-universe has a unique subdomain under r-universe.dev with a package repository from where packages can directly be installed. 
For example, the packages and information from rOpenSci can be found on https://ropensci.r-universe.dev, and packages maintained by Jeroen Ooms are listed at https://jeroen.r-universe.dev (note how these two sets overlap).

The top tabs allow you to explore different resources within universes.

### Builds Tab

The **Builds tab** shows the current state of the repository in a table, including:  
- Package name and version,  
- Commit date,  
- Author, and  
- Build status. 

Clicking on a package name takes you to its [homepage](/browse/packages.html), while clicking the maintainer’s name links to their subdomain, where you can explore other projects they maintain.


### Packages and Articles Tabs

The **Packages tab** lists descriptive information for all packages in the repository.

![Articles tab of a universe](../img/univ-articles.png){group="univ" fig-alt="Articles tab of a universe, showing all vignettes."}

The **Articles tab** displays all documents (e.g., vignettes).

### Contributors Tab

![Contributors tab of a universe](../img/univ-contributors.png){group="univ" fig-alt="Contributors tab of a universe, showing contribution activity per contributor."}

The **Contributors tab** shows a chart with contributor statistics for the organization or maintainer.  
Clicking a bar in the chart takes you to that contributor’s universe, where you can explore more of their work.  

### Installing Packages from a Universe

Each subdomain also hosts a CRAN-like package repository for the user or organization.  
To list or install packages from rOpenSci in R, you can use:

```r
# List available packages
available.packages(repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")

# Install a package
install.packages("magick", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```
